# aptly-api-gui

Proof of Concept for a HTML GUI for the [aptly API](https://www.aptly.info/doc/api/)
The GUI is implemented through [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

## Setup

We assume you proxy the aptly API at `/api` while serving this code from `/`.
Be sure to protect this from the server side though.

## Features

* provide dropdown of existing repositories
* show list of packages in the selected repository


## Development

This tool has been developed within the “Humanities at Scale” project.
This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement 675570.
