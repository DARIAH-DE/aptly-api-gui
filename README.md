# aptly-api-gui

Proof of Concept for a HTML GUI for the [aptly API](https://www.aptly.info/doc/api/)
The GUI is implemented through [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

## Setup

We assume you proxy the aptly API at `/api` while serving this code from `/`.
Be sure to protect this from the server side though.

## Features

* provide dropdown of existing repositories
* show list of packages in the selected repository
